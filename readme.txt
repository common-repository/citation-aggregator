Aggregates Delicious and Connotea feeds to aggregate links to websites (citations) and create posts with categorised lists of the aggregated links

== Description ==

The Citation Aggregator plugin aggregates links from [Delicious][1], [Connotea][2] and [Google Reader][3] websites and stores them inside the WordPress System. The plugin allows you to add categories to the aggregated links and also manually group links together using additional categories.

The websites are checked for new links approximately one every hour. The list of aggregated links are used to create an RSS feed, containing the most recent 10 links, and posts and pages containing lists of links using shortcodes.

The plugin is being used to help build a community at the [Libraries Interact][4] website.
